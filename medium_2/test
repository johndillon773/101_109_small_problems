# Write a method that computes the difference between the square of the sum of
# the first n positive integers and the sum of the squares of the first n positive
# integers.

# calculate sum of first n positive integers
# calculate square of that sum

# calculate all squares of first n positive integers
# calculate sum of these squares

# calculate difference between two
